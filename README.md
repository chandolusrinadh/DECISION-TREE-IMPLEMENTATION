PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

The goal of this project was to implement and visualize a Decision Tree Classifier using Python’s Scikit-learn library, applied on the well-known Iris dataset. This project not only involved building a predictive model, but also focused on comprehending how decision trees work, how they split data, and how to interpret their visual structure. The key deliverables included building the model, visualizing the tree, analyzing its structure using tree rules, and evaluating its performance through accuracy scores and classification reports.

A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is mostly used for classification tasks. It works by recursively splitting the dataset into subsets based on the value of input features, forming a tree structure where each node represents a condition and each leaf node represents a class label. One of the primary advantages of decision trees is their interpretability — they allow us to understand exactly why a certain decision was made.

In this project, we used the Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of iris flowers from three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample includes four features — sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width — that are used to predict the species.

The process involved several key steps:

Data Preparation: Using the load_iris() function from Scikit-learn, we loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and visualization.

Splitting the Dataset: The dataset was split into training and testing sets using train_test_split() to ensure unbiased model evaluation.

Model Training: A DecisionTreeClassifier was initialized with a fixed random state for reproducibility and trained on the training data.

Model Visualization: The decision tree was visualized using plot_tree() from Scikit-learn and matplotlib.pyplot. The visual representation helps to understand the logic behind the model’s classification process.

Rule Extraction: Using export_text(), we extracted the rules generated by the decision tree. This step is crucial in interpreting how the model splits the dataset at each node.

Model Evaluation: After prediction on test data, we used accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, and classification_report to evaluate the model’s performance. These metrics provided insights into how well the model performed across different classes.

Confusion Matrix Visualization: A heatmap was generated using seaborn.heatmap() to visualize the confusion matrix, making it easier to identify classification errors.

RESOURCES USED:

This project would not have been possible without access to a variety of helpful online resources. The primary tools and platforms used include:

ChatGPT: This AI assistant was extensively used to understand the concepts of decision trees, write and debug Python code, handle visualization issues, and improve the overall structure of the script. ChatGPT also helped in explaining the output components like the classification report and confusion matrix in detail.

Google: Quick searches were performed to resolve specific coding issues, such as errors with seaborn installation, matplotlib plotting problems in VS Code, and syntax clarifications. Google helped in finding documentation and community discussions on Stack Overflow, GitHub, and Scikit-learn’s official site.

YouTube Tutorials: Several YouTube videos were referenced to visually understand how decision trees work and how they are implemented using Scikit-learn. These videos also offered walkthroughs of model evaluation techniques and best practices for data visualization.

Scikit-learn Documentation: The official documentation was crucial for understanding parameter options in DecisionTreeClassifier, learning about model evaluation functions, and exploring the built-in datasets like Iris.

VS Code: The Visual Studio Code IDE provided a smooth development environment for writing and running the Python script, with features like integrated terminal, debugger, and extension support for Python.
